    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of short rib</li>
        <li>3 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, diced</li>
        <li>5 – 6 small ripe tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of cumin</li>
        <li>1 -2 dried chilies</li>
        <li>2 -3 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>3/4 of a bottle of red wine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heavily salt your short ribs and place in the fridge for up to 24 hours. Once, the dry brine is done pat dry your short ribs and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet add enough oil to generously cover the pan and set the heat to medium high. Sear each side of the short ribs until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the short ribs onto a plate & set aside. Set the heat to medium low and add in all your aromatics (carrots, celery, and onions). Immediately add salt and slowly caramelize your veggies for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While your veggies are caramelizing, head over to your spice drawer and grab your spices ( whole cumin, dried chilies, cardamom pods, and sliced garlic). Add them to a motar and pestle and give them a good grind before adding them into pan with your aromatics. Cook everything together for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add in your diced tomatoes and cook down for 5 minutes as well. After that add in 3/4 of a bottle of red wine and let that cook for another 5 minutes to reduce and cook off the alcohol.</li>
        <li>Place your short ribs back into the pan and add enough water to cover more than half of the short ribs.</li>
        <li>Cover with aluminum foil and place in the oven at 275 f for 3 -4 hours.</li>
        <li>Once it’s super tender, take it out of the oven, add in some chopped parsley. Serve while hot!</li>
    </ol>
